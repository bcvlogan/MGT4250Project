# Data Types (purpose/use, data type):
Mustang GT: Name of Car, string
Initial MSRP: starting price of mustang when first unveiled, number
Adj for inflation: Car value in today's dollars, number
Mustang horsepower: how much each model came with out of the factory, number
Tesla Model 3: year and model of car, string
Tesla MSRP: How much Tesla Costs, number
Tesla HP: Horsepower rating for vehicle, number

# Interpreting MSRP vs Adj for Inflation:
This visual provides an easy way for consumers to view cars that have been produced before the year 2000, and to see how their value has changed over the years so that consumers can see whether buying something new is worth it in the long run. This answers my question as it allows users to understand where they can get the most bang for their buck.
