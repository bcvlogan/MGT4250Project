# Data Types (purpose/use, data type):
Mustang GT: Name of Car, string
Initial MSRP: starting price of mustang when first unveiled, number
Adj for inflation: Car value in today's dollars, number
Mustang horsepower: how much each model came with out of the factory, number
Tesla Model 3: year and model of car, string
Tesla MSRP: How much Tesla Costs, number
Tesla HP: Horsepower rating for vehicle, number

# Interpreting MSRP vs Adj for Inflation:
This visual provides an easy way for consumers to view cars that have been produced before the year 2000, and to see how their value has changed over the years so that consumers can see whether buying something new is worth it in the long run. This answers my question as it allows users to understand where they can get the most bang for their buck.

# Article Link and Analysis:

Summary: This article compares ev and ice engine options from multiple manufacturers, such as Nissan and BMW. It also discusses how incentives in the market that apply to EV vehicles can help bring down the costs, and while also looking at initial price differences and what it takes to own the car over a year period. 

# Chat GPT Response to "Which type of drive train offers better price to performance: ev or ice engines in cars?"

Response:
When comparing electric vehicles (EVs) to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles based on price-to-performance, several key factors come into play:

Upfront Costs:

EVs: Historically more expensive due to battery costs, but prices have been decreasing. Incentives, rebates, and tax credits may reduce the price difference significantly.
ICE: Typically have lower upfront costs due to mature manufacturing processes.
Fuel Costs:

EVs: Much cheaper per mile due to the lower cost of electricity. Home charging can provide significant savings.
ICE: More expensive to fuel, especially with fluctuating gasoline prices.
Maintenance Costs:

EVs: Fewer moving parts lead to lower maintenance costs (no oil changes, less wear on brakes due to regenerative braking, etc.).
ICE: More complex engines mean more regular maintenance, leading to higher costs.
Longevity:

EVs: Batteries have improved lifespan and warranties, and other components typically last longer.
ICE: Well-maintained engines can also last long but typically need more repairs and replacements.
Performance:

EVs: Instant torque provides strong acceleration, which often translates to better performance.
ICE: Performance varies depending on engine type and configuration.
Depreciation:

EVs: Depreciation rates are stabilizing with the improvement of battery life.
ICE: Generally, standard depreciation rates apply, although factors like fuel prices can impact resale values.
Environmental Impact:

EVs: Generally have lower emissions over their lifecycle, especially when charged using renewable energy.
ICE: Emit more pollutants and contribute more to carbon emissions.
Conclusion:

Short-term Price-to-Performance: ICE vehicles might still be ahead due to lower initial costs.
Long-term Price-to-Performance: EVs tend to win due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. As battery technology improves and production scales up, the price-performance ratio will likely keep improving for EVs.

# Whether it matches visuals:
My visuals somewhat demonstrate this, as the mustang price has continually grown, so does the horsepower, however, on the price to performance page it clearly shows that Tesla has been reducing price while increasing power, which cannot be said for Ford. Ai also shows this with the discussion of more internal parts when it comes to ICE engine, leading to more maintainence and higher repair costs in comparison to EV vehicles. However EV vehicles often have a higher upfront cost in comparison to ICE engine vehicles.
